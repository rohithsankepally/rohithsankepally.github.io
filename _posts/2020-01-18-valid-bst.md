Given a binary tree, check whether it is a valid binary search tree.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before we go forward, it would be better to have some prior knowledge about binary search trees. Go through links given below, to get a good understanding of binary search trees.
 
[Introduction to Binary trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-1-introduction/)

[Introduction to Binary Search trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/)

[Introduction to Binary Search trees (BSTs)](https://www.scaler.com/topics/data-structures/binary-search-tree/)

> Note : In this post, the abbreviation BST is used to refer to a binary search tree.

Approach
---------

Given that you have a good understanding of **BST**, we all know that a **BST** satisfies the following property

For each node **N**


> 1. All nodes in the left subtree of **N** have a value smaller than **N**
> 2. All nodes in the right subtree of **N** have a value greater than **N**
> 3. The left & right subtrees of **N** should be valid **BST**s.


Now the challenge is to efficiently validate the above properties for every node of a tree. 

Let us try to analyze this problem by looking at a valid **BST** given below

We can clearly notice that this tree satisfies all the properties discussed above.

Let us say we want to traverse from the root of the tree and reach node **2**. The path would be **3** &rarr; **1** &rarr; **2** where **3** > **1**  and **1** < **2**

Thus, every node **N** in the **BST** can be mapped to a **min** and **max** value where the value of all the tree nodes with **N** as root lies within the interval [**min**, **max**]

Therefore in order to decide whether a **BST** is valid, for each node we compute this interval and check whether the above mentioned property is satisfied. So now the question is how do we compute this interval?



<br>
Let us get back to the example of valid **BST**.

We start at node **3**. Since node **3** is the root, it can have any value. So the interval for node **3** would be [-$$\infty$$, $$\infty$$].

Now we would like to compute the interval for node **1**. Since node **1** is the left child of node **3**, all the nodes with **1** as root can have a maximum value of **3**.
Therefore the **max** value for node **1**, would be **3** and thereby the interval for node **1** is [-$$\infty$$, **3**].

Similarly, since node **4** is on the right of node **3**, all the nodes with **4** as root should a minimum value of **3**. Therefore the **min** value for node 4, would be **3**. Thus the interval for node **4** is [**3**, $$\infty$$]. 

We repeat the same procedure to compute the intervals for each node recursively and check whether the nodeâ€™s value lies within its interval.

The intervals for the above **BST**

Time Complexity
---------------
In this implementation, every node is visited exactly once in the worst case.(when the given binary tree is a valid **BST**). Therefore the time complexity is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Space Complexity
---------------
This implementation does not use any additional space. So the space complexity is **O(1)**.
